Social media previews are your content's first impression. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore how to leverage NetFoundry's enhanced layout system to create previews that stop the scroll and drive engagement.

## Why Social Previews Matter

When someone shares your content on Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, or Discord, the preview card is often the deciding factor between a click and a scroll. Studies show that posts with compelling images receive **94% more views** than text-only posts.

<Alert title="Pro Tip" type="info">
The first 3 seconds are crucial - your preview needs to communicate value immediately.

## The Anatomy of a Great Social Preview

### 1. **Compelling Title** (55-60 characters)
Your title should be:
- Clear and descriptive
- Action-oriented when appropriate
- Optimized for the platform

```yaml
# Good ‚úÖ
title: "Zero Trust Security: 5 Implementation Strategies That Work"

# Bad ‚ùå
title: "Some thoughts on security and stuff we've been working on lately"
```

### 2. **Engaging Description** (155-160 characters)
- Expand on the title's promise
- Include a clear benefit or outcome
- Use active voice

### 3. **Visual Impact** (1200x630px recommended)
- High contrast and readable text
- Consistent branding
- Mobile-friendly design

## Implementation with NetFoundry Components

### Blog Posts
```tsx
import {SocialHead, createSocialPreview, blogSocialPreviewTemplate} from '@openclint/docusaurus-shared/ui';

<SocialHead socialMeta={createSocialPreview(config, blogSocialPreviewTemplate)({
  title: "Your Compelling Title",
  description: "A description that makes people want to click and read more.",
  image: "/img/custom-blog-header.jpg",
  author: "Your Name",
  section: "Category",
  tags: ["relevant", "tags"]
})} />
```

### Documentation Pages
```yaml

imageAlt: "API authentication flow diagram"

---
```

### Custom Pages
```tsx
const socialMeta = generateSocialMeta({
  title: "Landing Page Title",
  description: "Converting description text",
  image: "/img/landing-hero.jpg",
  type: "website"
});

return (
  <Layout>
    <SocialHead socialMeta={socialMeta} />
    {/* Page content */}
  </Layout>
);
```

## Platform-Specific Considerations

### Twitter/X
- Focuses on the image and first line of description
- 280-character limit affects sharing text
- Use `summary_large_image` card type

### LinkedIn
- Professional tone works best
- Company logos perform well
- Longer descriptions are acceptable

### Facebook
- Emphasizes the image heavily
- Description truncates around 300 characters
- Videos auto-play in previews

### Discord
- Clean, simple designs work best
- High contrast is important
- Embeds show full content

## Advanced Tips

Test different titles, descriptions, and images to see what resonates with your audience.
