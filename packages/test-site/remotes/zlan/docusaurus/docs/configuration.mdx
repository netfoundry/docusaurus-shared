# Configuring zLAN

## Basic setup

```bash
# Initialize zLAN
zlan init --network my-network

# Add a node
zlan join --token <enrollment-token>
```

## Network configuration

```json
{
  "network": "my-network",
  "nodes": [
    { "name": "node-1", "role": "gateway" },
    { "name": "node-2", "role": "client" }
  ]
}
```

:::tip
Use the `zlan status` command to verify connectivity between nodes.
