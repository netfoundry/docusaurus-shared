The Ziti Docs popular link checker job detected a problem. This means that one of the popular links from an external site or search engine to a Ziti docs page is broken. The page may have moved. A proxy or Docusaurus redirect may be needed. This issue will auto-resolve when the job succeeds. Follow the link to the failed job to see the error output from the link checker.
